## canvas-api-automations grades push

Pushes exported grades into Canvas

### Synopsis

This command will attempt to set any grades
in Canvas that are present in the export. If you want to
replace any existing grades, add --overwrite. For safety,
you must add --live to commit the grades, else it will simply
display proposed changes to the gradebook.

```
canvas-api-automations grades push <grade_export.csv> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help        help for push
      --live        Set to actually push grades into Canvas, otherwise reports changes
      --overwrite   Set to overwrite existing grades, otherwise skips them
```
